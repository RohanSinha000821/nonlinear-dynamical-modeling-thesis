## Overview

This thesis develops a nonlinear dynamical systems framework to study the coupled interaction between:

- Brainwave synchronization
- Cognitive load
- Adaptive learning (deep learning model accuracy)

The goal is to mathematically analyze how these interacting components influence stability, equilibrium behavior, and qualitative system transitions.

The model is formulated as a three-dimensional system of nonlinear ordinary differential equations (ODEs) incorporating interaction terms representing mutual coupling between neural synchronization and learning dynamics.

## Problem Formulation

A coupled nonlinear system was constructed to represent:

- Synchronization dynamics of neural activity
- Evolution of cognitive load
- Adaptive response of learning accuracy

The system incorporates:
- Logistic type growth components
- Nonlinear interaction terms
- Feedback mechanisms between cognitive state and learning performance
