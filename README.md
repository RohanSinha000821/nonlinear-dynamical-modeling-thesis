Integrated M.Sc. Thesis  
Birla Institute of Technology, Mesra (2025)

## Overview
This thesis develops a three-dimensional nonlinear dynamical system modeling the interaction between neural synchronization, cognitive load, and adaptive learning performance.

## Key Contributions
- Boundedness and invariant region analysis
- Equilibrium feasibility conditions
- Routh–Hurwitz stability analysis
- Transcritical and Hopf bifurcation analysis
- Analytical reduction to quadratic discriminant framework

## Document
The full thesis is available as a PDF in this repository.
